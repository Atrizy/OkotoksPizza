        <p>
          There are no short cuts when it comes to our passion. We pull out all
          the stops, giving you the ‘wow’ flavour, experience and consistency
          you not only want, but deserve. Our customers keep coming back, again,
          again, and again. We’re a small but nimble family-run take out and
          delivery pizza shop in Okotoks, Alberta. When we’re not scouring the
          globe (okay, the prairies) for the freshest, ripest and boldest
          ingredients, we’re crafting perfect pizzas for you and your family to
          enjoy. From hot Hawaiians and classic Canadians to crispy wings and
          decadent fudge brownies, everything at Okotoks Pizza is baked with
          love. After watching his parents run a very successful pizza business
          in Calgary, Matt Cleveland learned how to make people happy, one
          topping at a time. Opening the doors to Okotoks Pizza in 2004, Matt
          has managed to evolve the fresh, traditional Greek-style pizza his
          family perfected back in the mid 80s to a more modern and convenient
          comfort food for today’s family on the go. Okotoks Pizzas are made
          with only the freshest ingredients like mozzarella, roma tomatoes,
          made-from-scratch sauce and even features premium toppings like
          Sorriso Pepperoni, salami from Valbella meats and a healthy Flax
          crust. You feel good about ordering it. You feel good about eating it.
          And you feel even better knowing we're always ready to make you more.
